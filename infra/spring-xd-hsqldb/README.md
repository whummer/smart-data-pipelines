# Spring XD HSQLDB
A simple Docker image that runs a [HSQLDB](http://hsqldb.org/) process, to be used when running Spring XD in [distributed mode](http://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/#running-distributed-mode).

You don't need to use this exact image, any image that runs HSQLDB and `EXPOSE`s the server port is certainly fine.
